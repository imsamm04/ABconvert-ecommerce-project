## Getting Started

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root of your project with the necessary environment variables. You can copy the `.env.example` file and fill in the required values, such as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

3. **Running the Application**: Use one of the following commands to start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **API Key**: Make sure to place your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file under `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`. This key is used to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API.
